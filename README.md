# Description:
TalkGPT is a web application that leverages the power of the OpenAI GPT-3.5 language model to create an interactive conversational experience. Built using Flask and Vanilla JavaScript, TalkGPT allows users to input their queries or messages using both text and voice. The application generates human-like responses based on the input and provides the option to listen to the responses using synthesized speech. With TalkGPT, users can have natural conversations with the AI-powered model using their voice or text. Contributions to the project are welcome, and the application is licensed under the MIT License.
